# Spotify Music Trends &amp; Intelligence: Recommendation, Classification, and Emerging Artist Discovery
A data science project designed to uncover emerging artists, analyze popularity drivers across music genres, and build an audio-based recommendation system using a real-world Spotify tracks dataset.

This project simulates the responsibilities of a Content Analytics - Music Partnerships Data Scientist at Spotify, focusing on:

- Data-driven music discovery

- Predictive insights into artist and genre performance

- Strategic intelligence for partnerships and promotion
# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes Spotify tracks with audio features, genre labels, and popularity scores. [Data Source]

Columns include:

- track_name, main_artist, track_genre, popularity

- Audio features: danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo，explicit, duration_ms, mode, etc.

# Project Highlights
## 1. Audio-Based Recommendation System
Build a **content-based recommender** that suggests songs based on user-preferred audio traits (e.g. high energy, fast tempo, happy mood).

- Input: User-defined feature preferences

- Output: Top 5 most similar tracks using KNN + cosine similarity

- Example: Recommend high energy, medium speechiness, low acousticness


## 2. Genre Classification Using Audio Features
Use a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict a song’s genre based on its audio signature.

- Trained on 114 genres

- Evaluated with precision, recall, F1-score

- Identified well-performing classes (e.g., comedy, drum-and-bass) and poorly performing ones (e.g., anime, dub) due to feature overlap

## 3. Emerging Track & Artist Discovery
Identify tracks and artists that are **not yet mainstream** but exhibit **high potential** based on audio characteristics.

- Focus on tracks with mid-range popularity (40–70)

- Construct an emerging score:
`emerging_score = danceability + energy + valence + tempo_norm - loudness_penalty

- Rank top tracks and artists to uncover future hits`

## 4. Popularity Drivers by Genre
Answer: What drives track popularity within each genre?

- Trained separate linear regression models per genre

- Quantified how features like valence, tempo, or acousticness influence popularity in each genre

- Insight:

  - valence strongly boosts popularity in pop and dance pop

In metal, lower valence (darker tone) correlates with higher popularity
